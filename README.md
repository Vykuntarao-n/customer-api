# Getting Started

### Start Application
* Run the `CustomerapiApplication` Application
* Default application runs on the port http://localhost:8080
* When there are any port in use errors in the console override the port by setting the `server.port=808x` (where x is any number) in the `application.properties`
* Application comes with H2 in memory database.
  * [Quick Start on H2 Database](https://www.h2database.com/html/quickstart.html)
  * URL to access the [H2 DB Admin console](http://localhost:8080/h2-console)
  * Enter `JDBC URL` as  `jdbc:h2:mem:testdb`
* To run the application with Microsoft SQL Server
  * Add the dependency in `build.gradle` file
    ```
    implementation 'com.microsoft.sqlserver:mssql-jdbc'
    ```

  * Add the below configuration in `application.properties`
    ```
    spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.format_sql=true
    spring.datasource.url= jdbc:sqlserver://localhost:1433;encrypt=true;trustServerCertificate=true;databaseName=sqlserver_db
    spring.datasource.username= sqlserver
    spring.datasource.password= admin
    spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.dialect= org.hibernate.dialect.SQLServerDialect
    spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto= update
    ```
### Test the api from postman
* Postman collection is available at location `src\test\newman`
* Here is the reference link to [import the postman collection](https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/importing-and-exporting/importing-data/)
* Once the Postman collection is imported, it will contain all the customer operations.
  * GET is to SELECT SQL operation
    * Get all the list of Customers `GET http://localhost:8080/api/customers`
    * Get a customer with id `http://localhost:8080/api/customers/{id}`
  * POST is INSERT SQL Operation
    * Add customer `POST http://localhost:8080/api/customers`. Customers details will be send in the RequestBody.
  * PUT is to UPDATE SQL Operation
    * Update Customer `PUT http://localhost:8080/api/customers/{id}` Customers details will be send in the RequestBody.
  * DELETE is to DELETE SQL Operation
    * Delete Customer `DELETE http://localhost:8080/api/customers/{id}`
